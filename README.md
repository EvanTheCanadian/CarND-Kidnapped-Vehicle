# Particle Filter Project
Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

## Project Introduction
Your robot has been kidnapped and transported to a new location! Luckily it has a map of this location, a (noisy) GPS estimate of its initial location, and lots of (noisy) sensor and control data.

In this project you will implement a 2 dimensional particle filter in C++. Your particle filter will be given a map and some initial localization information (analogous to what a GPS would provide). 
At each time step your filter will also get observation and control data.

Requires the Udacity Term 2 simulator to run
